Title: Quasi-analytical solution for logit
Version: 0.1.2

Maintainer: Lisa Maag <lisa.maag@gfk.com>
Description: The package provides a quasi-analytical solution for logit models. 
    Numerical optimization for logit models is often time consuming, at least for big data. This package avoids this problem with a quasi-analytical approach. 
    The resulting coefficients are especially suitable for imputation models, but they differ from GLM results. Therefore the coefficients are less suitable for statistical modelling and interpretation.
    The predictQAS-Function can be used after the main QAS.func-Function to categorize numeric variables in the same way as the QAS.func-Function for calculating the coefficients. 
    The function can also predict values for the dependent variable based on the coefficients of QAS.func and the dataset used for categorization.
